## Bee Interaction Database
This repository has been deprecated. Please see [Bee Interaction Database](https://github.com/Extended-Bee-Network/bee-interaction-database) for the active version.

### Description

bee-interaction-database is a repository for interaction and ecological trait data about bees (Hymenoptera). The observations are from the literature and focused on food, parasites, nesting biology, body size and other bee traits.

This GitHub repository was cloned from [globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset), which includes a blank interactions.tsv, README and globi.json. GloBI requires that the interactions.tsv be called interactions.tsv and for the globi.json file to exist. Some column headers of inteteractions.tsv file was modified from the cloned template, but follow the naming conventions.

### BioticInteraction Types

The biotic species interactions in this dataset were mapped to terms in the Relations Ontology (RO). Biotic interactions are best viewed through [Global Biotic Interactions](https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/)

interactionTypeName | interactionTypeId | description
--- | --- | --- |
visits | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002618 |

eats | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002470 |
(biotically) interacts with | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002437 | An interaction relationship in which at least one of the partners is an organism and the other is either an organism or an abiotic entity with which the organism interacts.
ecologically co-occurs with | http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0008506 | An interaction relationship describing organisms that often occur together at the same time and space or in the same environment.

### otherTraits
Presently, otherTraits are listed as a key:value list (delimited by semicolons). These include body size, nesting behavior, and any other traits that are not considered biotic interactions. Trait terms are following [Encyclopedia of Life - TraitBank](https://eol.org/traitbank). Traits are defined as being either from the source or target taxon. They can be sourceGeneralObservation/targetGeneralObservation, which indicate overall study results, or sourceCommonKnowledge/targetCommonKnowledge, which indicates general knowledge about the taxon.

 
### Data Definitions

The definitions of the columns used in the interactions.tsv dataset are described here. If these correspond with Darwin Core they are mapped to those classes. Some of the columns in the template were unused.

  * **InteractionID** : An non-unique identifier that links two interactions as part of the same observation in the dataset.
  * **basisOfRecord** [DWC:BasisOfRecord](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/basisOfRecord) : The specific nature of the data record. For literature use LiteratureRecord.
  * **interactionText** : The phrase or phrases copied verbatim from the text that describe the interaction.
  * **sourceTaxonId** [DWC:scientificNameID](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/scientificNameID) : An identifier for the nomenclatural (not taxonomic) details of a scientific name.
  * **sourceTaxonName** [DWC:scientificName](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/scientificName) : The lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined.
  * **sourceVerbatimName** : An OTU, morphospecies or other designation of the taxon.
  * **sourceFamilyName** [DWC:family](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/family) : The family name of the source taxon.
  * **sourceCommonName** [DWC:vernacularName](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/Taxon) : common or vernacular name.

  * **sourceSexID**  : Identifer for the sex name.
  * **sourceLifeStageName** [DWC:sex](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/lifeStage) : TThe age class or life stage of the biological individual(s) at the time the Occurrence was recorded.

  * **interactionTypeId** : Identifier for the interaction type.
  * **interpretedInteractionTypeName** : The name or term applied to the identifier of the interaction type as reported by the linked ontology.

  * **interactionTypeName** : interaction type (ex. eats, piercing). The name of the interaction type should be the name as it is listed in the original text, which is not always the name of the term it is mapped to. As long as the definition to the mapping is compatible with the ```interactionTypeName```, it is usable as a ```interactionTypeId```.
  * **targetBodyPartName**  : The specific name of the target body part. The name of the body part should be the name as it is listed in the original text, which is not always the name of the term it is mapped to. As long as the definition to the mapping is compatible with the ```targetBodyPartName```, it is usable as a ```targetBodyPartId```.
  * **targetBodyPartId**  : Identifer for the body part name.
  * **experimentalConditionName**  : ("in nature" - most common)
  * **experimentalConditionId** : 
  * **targetTaxonId** [DWC:scientificNameID](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/scientificNameID) : An identifier for the nomenclatural (not taxonomic) details of a scientific name.

### Included Resources
Literature used in this project is recorded on each record. If you have a new paper to add, please submit a [new github issue](https://github.com/seltmann/bee-interaction-database/issues/new) or add it to the [Bee Interaction Database group](https://www.mendeley.com/community/bee-interaction-database/) on Mendeley.


### Data Issues
Interactions are focused at genus and below for bees. Other traits beside biotic interactions are included as a key:value pair in the other traits field. This field is presently descriptive.
